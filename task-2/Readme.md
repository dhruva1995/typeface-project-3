# Project: Surface Identification using Computer Vision

This project focuses on identifying surfaces in images using computer vision techniques. The goal is to detect and extract contours that represent the boundaries of objects or surfaces within an image.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure that you have Python 3 and pip installed on your system.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main.py file by executing the following command:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
4. Once the application is launched, a window will appear, allowing you to select an image for analysis.
5. Choose an image by clicking on the window and selecting the desired file.
6. The application will detect contours within the selected image and display them in varying shades of gray.

## Key Learnings

Throughout the development of this project, several key learnings were gained:

1. Problem Statement: The project aimed to address the challenge of identifying surfaces within images.
2. Contour Detection: Due to time constraints and my relative novelty in the field of computer vision, I focused on implementing contour detection as a fundamental technique.
3. Future Directions: The project laid the foundation for potential advancements by combining contour detection with depth analysis to achieve more accurate surface identification.
4. Image Operations: The project provided an opportunity to gain familiarity with fundamental image operations, including reading and writing images, grayscale conversion, generating gradients, and performing morphological operations like dilation and erosion.
5. OpenCV and Python: This project marked my first practical application of OpenCV using Python, allowing me to gain hands-on experience in image processing and computer vision.
